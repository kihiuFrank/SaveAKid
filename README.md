## SaveAKid

### About the project

A donations platform for connecting donors & charity organizations with children's homes taking care of disadvantaged children in society.

### Problem

1. Misappropriation of donations (The Govt of Kenya wanted to abolish children's homes as a result) - we provide a platform where orphanages and children’s homes interact directly with donors.

2. No awareness - a dedicated platform will lead to more reach & impact.

3. Accountability - Periodic updates from children's homes through video on ongoing projects.

- A rating score from donors determining which homes had the most impact.

4. No relationship/personal connection between donors and the kids - a dedicated platform will encourage personal and recurring donations.

Children’s homes must be verified members.

### Challenges

Adding the withdraw donations functionality for children's/care homes separately. I managed to withdraw the donations as SaveAKid entity but that's not ideal. Different care homes should withdraw their donations separately and when they want to.

### Technologies

Backend - Hardhart, Solidity, Chai & Mocha, ethers

Frontend - NextJs, Vercel, react, viem, wagmi, connectkit, headlessui, tailwind

SaveAKid uses the Ethereum blockchain to solve the problems in the charity sector which are mostly due to its centrality. A decentralized platform is crucial to the type of governance we are trying to achieve and Ethereum is our answer on how to do it.
