              Today we got to visit the drop in facility for street kids in one
              part of Nairobi run by SaveAKid.<Mark> What a privilege.</Mark>{" "}
              With our schools, I enjoy thinking of how we work with kids there.
              What I could see was how we build self-confidence and integrity in
              the kids, which is a main goal of Child Africa.

              "My family has been having an annual party for the past four years
              to raise money to help the kids. I like how they assign the money
              that we help raise to a project and they send us updates with
              pictures <Mark>so you know where your money is going to</Mark>.
              They are making a difference and we will continue to support
              them."

              It is really powerful to see the <Mark>huge difference</Mark> it
              is possible to make with relatively small amounts of money. I am
              impressed with the work SaveAKid does and the ability to make
              something out of nothing.
